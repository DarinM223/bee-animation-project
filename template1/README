1) Ubuntu 12.04, vim and make using custom Makefile (I changed some header files meant for Mac to Linux so it will not compile on Mac computers.
anim.cpp worked in Visual Studio though when I replaced the default anim.cpp with it and kept the other files the same)
2) In anim.cpp, changed display() function, created multiple functions to draw the ground
and the various parts of the bee and flower/tree.

3) 
   a) 5/5
   b) 1/1
   c) 2/2
   d) 2/2
   e) 4/4 
   f) 5/5
   g) 3/3
   h) 2/2
   i) In general it looks qualitatively and visually similar to the example video.
